                    1,197,405 is 260% of 457,300(ie., population of Canberra), which is the count of total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases recorded worldwide as of 4th April 2020.
                    We can inference from the blue curve in the grpah that the spread of the virus is not under control in some parts of the world.
                    This made me think what if everyone had an opportunity to know about COVID and its symptoms and safety measures prior. 60,000+ people lives could have been saved.
                    Never so late, I am gonna educate my people through this site.
