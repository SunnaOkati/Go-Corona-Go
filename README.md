### Description
gocoronago.com is a simple website built to offer knowledge on preventive and safety measures against COVID-19, and simple analysis and information on the COVID-19 cases in a single place to all the fellow human beings. As an individual and sibling of a doctor, I am doing my part here helping my brother while he is fighting to save lives in India just like heroes.

This website educates the users on safety measures like a proper hand wash, social distancing...etc., with pictures and textual explanations. To people confusing flu with normal COVID-19, the website clarifies by clearly tabulating the differences in their symptoms. It also assists the user visually by pointing the nearby hospitals on a map. For people who love graphs, the upcoming services are going to be a treat. The website provides information like the number of active cases and a graph on the growth of cases in the country/province in which the user is residing.
