            &nbsp From first day, I am in love with this course. Specifically, I love the idea of splitting the website development into three stages.
            So we can concentrate on this assignment all over the semester, and produce good results by updating your website as we move through the course.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp In the first assignment, we had to think a lot about the skeleton which will we working on through out the semester. So we had to choce our ideas wisely.
            Once choosen, we had to write an outline of our idea for the website. This was really helpful in laying a string foundations. I struggled in the early stages with the terminologies like sitemap and source log.
            But Tom always managed to give us enough time to settle, and release our stress. Because of that I was back in my feet soon. While trying to understand what sitemap is, I understood its real importance.
            Sitemaps help google to scrawl through our pages, as a result of that both ourselves and google are benifited by visit count. 
            But assignment 1 should have required such an indepth implementation, which I personally prefer as it could keep us in industry standards.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp Second part of the website development was a bit more industring than first part, as it involved some challenging tasks and more coding.
            I learnt to use apis in my websites, and how they work. And I can differentiate api from plug-in which I couldn't do before. Having to choose between story borad and javascript was really helpful.
            I chose js, but I never knew I would regret that decision. After seeing my friend's videos and storyboards, I wanted to do one. But I couldn't do it, as I had no time and it wasn't necesarry later as well.
            By the end of this part, I had posted 7 posts in piazza. I had to accept that those were my first interations in piazza ever since I joined ANU. They are motivational, and helpful in lots of ways.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp And now in the final part, as there isn't any clear criteria for few tasks I am a bit lost. But still, I searched the open space for options. And I am happy with what I am submitting. 
            Because I know what I did, and I know i can do it later as well.
